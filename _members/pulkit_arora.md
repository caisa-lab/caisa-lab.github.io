I am a masterâ€™s student in Media Informatics at RWTH Aachen University. Currently, I'm doing my thesis at the CAISA lab under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lucie Flek. My research focuses on how large language models (LLMs) can handle different linguistic style paraphrasing and question-answering tasks. I use various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based architectures, especially focusing on recent LLMs like LLaMA to evaluate and improve the robustness and generalization of LLMs. My research interests include supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language analytics, transformers, and NLP.
