I am an NLP researcher at the University of Bonn under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lucie Flek in the Conversational AI and Social Analytics (CAISA) lab. My research is focused on bridging the gap between Conversation, Information Seeking, and Personalization with the long-term goal of instilling human-like communication, subjective reasoning, and commonsense knowledge in machines.
I am broadly interested in building and evaluating conversational systems that improve personalized/opinionated information-seeking experiences for users. My current research interests include conversation modeling, opinionated dialogue generation, argument mining, and gamification for evaluating dialogues.Prior to this, I received a Masterâ€™s degree in 2021 in Data Science as well as a Master's in 2018, and a Bachelor's degree in 2012 in Industrial Engineering.
