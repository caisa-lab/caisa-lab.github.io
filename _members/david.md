I'm a PhD student at the University of Bonn under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lucie Flek since August 2024. My current research interests include large language model (LLM)-based web agents and planning algorithms to enhance LLMs' reasoning and problem solving capabilities. I am also interested in conversational agents and applications of reinforcement learning in the field of NLP.

## Areas of Interest:
 - LLM agents
 - Planning with LLMs
 - Conversational agents
 - Reinforcement learning/NLP
