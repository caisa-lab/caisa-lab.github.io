I am a postdoc in Prof. Flek's group since November 2023. I started my PhD at Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar and had my defense at Paderborn University. In the past years, I focused on using NLP methods to tackle media bias problems, including analyzing media bias and mitigating media bias. Especially, I have done a significant amount of work on using natural language generation in the bias mitigation part. Besides, I also worked on computational argumentation and computer-assisted language learning as my side projects.

I would like to have my research on solving real problems from a computer scientist's perspective. As a result, tackling social science problems, especially media bias, is always the core of my research. I look forward to hearing that we researchers can help improve our modern society.
