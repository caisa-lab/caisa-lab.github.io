I am a master's student in computer science at the University of Bonn, with a focus on artificial intelligence. At the moment, I am working on my master's thesis in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a particular emphasis on conversational language models. My passion is developing software that makes artificial intelligence (AI) more accessible for use in everyday life and research. Apart from my thesis work, I have worked on other lab projects that explore the fields of signal processing and audio. My knowledge of the multidisciplinary nature of cutting-edge technology has grown as a result of these experiences, which have also expanded my skill set. Also after conducting some research in the area of AI ethics, I am certain that developing a thorough grasp of this subject is essential for anyone working in the artificial intelligence industry as a whole. Other than the
academic experiences, I have worked in the industry since 2014 focusing on web development as a back-end and front-end developer in various industrialized and startup projects.
