My main interests are NLP and LLMs, particularly in areas such as transformer architectures and model fine-tuning. I am also interested in applications of LLMs in text summarization, question answering, and knowledge representation. I'll be working on the Maze task navigation, which mainly uses an LLM to produce different samples and continuations to generate the next best token. And also Iâ€™d like to work on different projects as well if assigned.
