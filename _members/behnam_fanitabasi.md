Data Science and Machine Learning, particularly Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, are my areas of interest. Generally speaking, I like to build frameworks with preprocessing stages and various ML techniques to extract insights from different data for various applications. Currently, my focus is on Large Language Models and developing methods for analyzing/evaluating them before any downstream task and detecting out-of-distribution data w.r.t the models.
