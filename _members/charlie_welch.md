I have been working on predicting conversational behavior (mainly what people will say) in longitudinal dialog using insights from  conversations. I am more broadly interested in dialog systems and personalization. I have been looking into ways to create personalized language models when different volumes of data and different types of metadata are available. In the past, I have also worked on parsing, and sentiment analysis. Recently, I've been looking for ways to apply natural language processing to help reduce anxiety surrounding COVID-19, mitigate bias in language models, and how to customize language models for mental health and misinformation applications.
