I'm a phd student under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lucie Flek and Dr. Charles Welch. Currently my research interests lie in the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in the domain of cross-lingual. In addition, I am also interested in transfer learning and motivational learning in the field of LLM.


## Areas of Interest
  <pre>
- Robustness of LLM
- Emotion recognition
- Transfer learning
- Multimodal learning
