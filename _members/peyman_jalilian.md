As a Data Science master's graduate from the University of Marburg, my academic and professional pursuits are deeply rooted in machine learning and its practical applications. My interests span a broad spectrum, including computer vision and the expansive field of natural language processing (NLP). My master's thesis reflects this passion, focusing on how text augmentation can enhance neural network models in NLP. Beyond my studies, I am captivated by the prospects of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its potential to revolutionize various domains. This blend of practical machine learning applications and a forward-looking perspective on AGI drives my enthusiasm for contributing to the field's future advancements. I am also interested in Autonomous driving and more particularly in computer vision applications.
