My area of interest lies in teaching machines to predict user behavior over time and in natural language processing. Specifically, I focus on training models to understand and represent text in a way that can be used across different areas and languages.
Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis at CAISA lab, diving into the task of spotting misinformation. My specific focus is on identifying cross-lingual propaganda techniques across various types of text including tweets and articles, intending to benefit low-resource languages such as Arabic. By developing advanced models and employing innovative techniques and exploring the application of data augmentation methods.
