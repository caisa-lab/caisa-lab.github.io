I am a researcher in Prof. Flek's research group. I started here in August 2024. My background is in biology and bioinformatics; I completed my master's degree at the University of Cologne in 2023. I am very interested in data extraction and text mining tasks, particularly in the biomedical field. During my master's, I worked with the DLR on analyzing new radiation treatments for lung cancer, via RNA-seq analysis. Now, I am focusing on making the knowledge buried in the vast number of papers published on cancer more accessible and easier to overview. To this end, I aim to use LLMs and other NLP tools to extract and connect knowledge across a large body of literature, to improve our understanding of cancer and to make the lives of biomedical researchers easier.
