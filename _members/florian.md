I have been a postdoc at CAISA since October 2024, working on web agents, planning, and alignment. Previously, I received my PhD from EPFL in 2023, where I graduated with a thesis on low-cost natural language understanding. Subsequently, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at KU Leuven, where I worked on planning algorithms for language modeling.

## Areas of Interest
