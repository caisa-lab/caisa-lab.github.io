I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Bonn, working on my thesis under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lucie Flek. My focus lies in exploring methods to explain Machine Learning models and their predictions, specifically in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) area. This stems from the widespread lack of transparency in most models within this domain, commonly denoted as black boxes.
