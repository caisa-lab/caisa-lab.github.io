My research focuses on patterns of circadian rhythms and how they affect users' sentiment towards different topics. Currently, I am investigating changes in sentiment towards Covid-19, depending on time of day and day of week, adjusted for overall changes depending on relevant events and respective news. I am aiming to fill a research gap for German Twitter usage, where mostly English- and Spanish-based research was conducted previously.
