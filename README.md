<h1 align="center">CAISA Lab</h1>

In the **Conversational AI and Social Analytics (CAISA) Lab**, [we](team) combine diverse expertise from 
areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and computational social sciences, 
on a mission to understand people behind the language.  

We incorporate personal and social context 
into our language understanding and language generation models, aiming at building 
more user-centric conversational agents as well as more accurate web discourse interpretation systems.

CAISA Lab is led by [Prof. Lucie Flek](https://lucieflek.github.io/) and resides mainly at the [Bonn-Aachen International Center for Information Technology (b-it)](https://www.b-it-center.de) in Bonn Germany and [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb12) of the Philipps Universit√§t Marburg in Germany.
