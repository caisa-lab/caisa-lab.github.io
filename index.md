# <i class="fas fa-flask"></i>About us

In the **Conversational AI and Social Analytics (CAISA) Lab**, [we](team) combine diverse expertise from 
areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and computational social sciences, 
on a mission to understand people behind the language.  

We incorporate personal and social context 
into our language understanding and language generation models, aiming at building 
more user-centric conversational agents as well as more accurate web discourse interpretation systems.

CAISA Lab is led by [Prof. Lucie Flek](https://lucieflek.github.io/) and resides at the 
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp) of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt in Germany.
