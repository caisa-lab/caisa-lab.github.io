We are looking forward to present our [paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/docs/emnlp21_hypermixup.pdf) "HYPMIX: Hyperbolic Interpolative Data Augmentation"  from Ramit Sawhney, Megh Thakkar, Shivam Agarwal, Di Jin, Diyi Yang, Lucie Flek at EMNLP 2021. 

In this paper we propose HypMix, a novel model-, data-, and modality-agnostic interpolative data augmentation technique operating in the hyperbolic space, which captures the complex geometry of input and hidden state hierarchies better than its contemporaries. 

We devise a novel MÃ¶bius Gyromidpoint Label Estimation (MGLE) method to predict soft labels for unlabeled data, and extend HYPMIX to a hyperbolic semi-supervised learning method. We evaluate HypMix on benchmark and low resource datasets across speech, text, and vision modalities, , including semi-supervised settings for Urdu and Arabic tasks. HypMix outperforms several strong baselines and Euclidean counterparts across these tasks.
