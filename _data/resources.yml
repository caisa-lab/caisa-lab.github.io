- title: Dynamically Social Natural Language Processing for Discourse Analysis
  type: featured
  image: images/userwoman.png
  description: The DynSoDA project will model the discourse aspects of language together with the deep representations of user characteristics and latent social network profiles derived from online dialogues. In contrast to current approaches, user representations will be treated as dynamically contextual. The project further envisions the use of transfer learning techniques at multiple levels of abstraction to work robustly across a range of NLP tasks related to social discourse (such as opinion detection, hate speech identification, or argument persuasiveness prediction).

- title: Personalization of Conversational Agents
  type: featured
  image: images/Conversational.png
  description: This project focuses on exploring the applications of pre-trained contextual user representations in the area of dialog modeling, improving quality and coherence of human-machine conversations. We explore how personalized modeling of both sides of the conversation influences the user behavior. What are the expectations on a personality of a conversational assistant? How subjective shall chatbots be in conversational persuasion? Do more subjective chatbot dialogs lead to more user interest in the topic?

- title: Synthetic Data Generation and Paraphrasing for Chatbots
  type: legacy
  image: images/Conversational.png
  description: Large amounts of annotated training data are necessary to develop task-oriented dialogue systems, which is very costly, time-consuming and requires high manual efforts, especially for annotating the data. Dialogues between users and the system are difficult to obtain, often they are created manually by crowd workers.

- title: User Representation Learning across Conversational Environments
  type: legacy
  image: images/userwoman.png
  description: User embedding led to substantial performance improvements in several downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection or hate speech detection. The relevance of information gained from it is best explained by the idea of homophily, i.e., the phenomenon that people tend to associate more with those who appear similar. From a psychological point of view, however, a specific social situation is of great influence to the expressed behavior. This work aims to investigate the possibility of enhancing various downstream tasks by substituting context-free (static) user embeddings with contextualized ones dependent on the environment (e.g. Subreddit) or social situation.

- title: Understanding an Appropriate Opinionated Chatbot Style
  type: legacy
  image: images/Conversational.png
  description: Summarization and stylistic paraphrasing of opinionated text to generate chatbot answers. When answering requests of users, a chatbot should present information in a neutral way. The correct answer often has to be extracted from various online sources. However, this data may contain swear words or other unacceptable statements that should not be repeated, e.g. presenting a verbatim opinion of a single radical user as a summary. Moreover, a summary which is otherwise fine might feel out of place in a conversational setting. Therefore, the summary still has to be paraphrased to a different style. When paraphrasing opinionated content, the goal is not only to keep the content but also the opinion polarity. Understanding chatbot appropriateness could help to make conversational agents more robust to opinionated or offensive data and thus more applicable to real world problems.

- title: Sociodemographic Analysis of Social Media Opinion Bubbles
  type: legacy
  image: images/Network.png
  description: Social media platforms have become an integral part of political discourse. This seemingly beneficial democratic process is accompanied by the forming of echo chambers. Having collected nearly 1 million social media posts and comments from over 200.000 unique users, we experiment with several algorithms to identify the subcommunities on 14 controversial topics, and examine their estimated socio-demographic profiles. We explore the correlation between an echo chamber network shape and the socio-demographic separation of the discussion participants.

- title: Analyzing the Personal Settings of Fake News Spreaders
  type: legacy
  image: images/Network.png
  description: We analyze characteristics of users that are vulnerable to internalizing and spreading Fake News. With the help of veracity servers such as Snopes.com we identify users that are spreading false information and explore if we find common personal and social network characteristics in their profiles based on a collection of their social media posts.

- title: Effects of Personal and Social Factors on Fluctuations in Expressed Opinions
  type: legacy
  image: images/userwoman.png
  description: Social media have been a place for very passionate discussions regarding controversial topics. Do these discussions have any effect or are we all stubborn victims of our filter bubbles? Using data from social media conversations of the same users over several months, the aim of this project is to find if social media users ever weaken or strengthen the intensity with which they communicate their opinion to others, and if so, what are the possible interactions and personal factors causing such a change.

- title: Conversational Opinionated Question Answering
  type: legacy
  image: images/Conversational.png
  description: Perhaps not surprisingly, opinion QA systems generate a wide variety of subjective and possibly contradictory answers. Just as opinions diverge among different users, answers to such questions may also be subjective, opinionated, and varied. Answering such questions automatically is quite different from typical QA tasks, where it is assumed that a single “correct” answer is available. In this pilot study we explore user preferences in navigating a conversational recommendation system prototype.

# Thesis
- title: A poor man’s opinion detection tool, training a model with a handful of data
  type: thesis
  description: Opinion detection aims to detect an author’s view towards a certain topic and has become a key component in everyday applications such as fake news detection and argumentation. While state-of-the-art deep learning models are ideal for this problem, they need lots of labeled training data that is often expensive to obtain. In order to reduce data collection costs, we can use few-shot-learning models which are specifically designed for learning with a very small amount of training data. Since most of our data comes from social media, we need a tool that can differentiate useful text from noisy, unopinionated posts. To this end, this thesis aims to develop an opinion detection model that can efficiently differentiate opinionated from non-opinionated text and is trained only on a small amount of data.

- title: Investigating the level of stubbornness regarding sociopolitical views in social media
  type: thesis
  description: While social media platforms help to connect people worldwide and give access to enormous amounts of diverse information, they also foster an environment that promotes polarization. This occurs due to the fact that users show a tendency to consume content that aligns with their political leaning and join groups adhering to their beliefs. This phenomenon leads to the formation of segregated clusters, which are known as “echo chambers”. We aim to investigate the opinion formation between different user groups depending on the diversity of information they encounter through their social media usage. This analysis involves clusters formed based on (a) their political ideologies and (b) their tendency to disseminate false information.

- title: Size matters - Data augmentation for stance detection
  type: thesis
  description: Data augmentation techniques are used to generate additional, synthetic data using already existing data. While images can be augmented easily by transformations such as rotations or changes of the RGB channel without affecting the classification models, text augmentation is much more difficult because there are no universal rules for automatic textual data transformations that can be applied while maintaining the meaning of the text. Therefore this thesis aims to investigate various natural language generation techniques for paraphrasing opinionated text and evaluate the quality of the generated data on opinion detection.

# Ongoing Theses
- title: Bootstrapping Receptive Communities for Classification of Receptive Language
  type: ongoing_thesis
  description: Receptiveness, or how willing someone is to thoughtfully engage with opposing views, is known to contribute to more successful conversational interactions. It is desirable to be able to identify this language automatically in order to analyze and build systems that use this type of language. A few receptiveness classifiers have been built using small existing datasets with receptiveness annotations. Using these, what Reddit communities do we hypothesize will be more or less receptive? What makes them receptive and how do they differ? Leveraging data from receptive communities, we can retrain a receptiveness classifier and evaluate it using annotated data. Additional experiments may include analysis of silver data; annotated by the agreement of multiple classifiers, and the resulting impact on building a new classifier.

- title: Personalized Models for Fake News Detection
  type: ongoing_thesis
  description: Detecting fake news online is an important and timely issue. We are interested in investigating personal differences in how fake news is spread and developing models to detect fake news. Our group has collected data for this task and for thousands of Reddit users. This can be used to test models for personalization from embeddings, language models, priming, or others. These models have been not been used for many downstream applications and we are interested to find out if these can be more widely applied and how performance differs on downstream tasks. Each method requires a different amount of computation and memory so there are trade-offs to consider.

- title: Extending Receptive Text Generation Models for Longer Documents
  type: ongoing_thesis
  description: Receptive communication, or the willingness to engage thoughtfully with opposing views, is important to having cooperative, successful conversations. Our lab has obtained preliminary results on generating paraphrases of text input to create more receptive outputs. This preliminary work was performed on sentences and in this work we are interested in extending this to longer texts or documents. This adds additional challenges through the interplay of sentences conveying different information but sharing the same receptive style.

- title: Controllable Generation Using kNN Language Models
  type: ongoing_thesis
  description: Language modeling forms the foundation of many language processing problems and involves predicting which words come next in a sequence. Recent work on kNN language models has shown improved perplexity by storing encodings of sentence contexts and retrieving similar contexts to alter the probability distribution when predicting the next token(Khandelwal et al. 2020). If we store not only the encoding, but also labeled stylistic attributes of a sentence (e.g.politeness, formality, toxicity), can we use this to control generated language to contain these attributes to higher or lower degrees while preserving fluency? How can these stored attributes and encodings be leveraged most effectively?
