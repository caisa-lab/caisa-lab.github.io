- title: Dynamically Social Natural Language Processing for Discourse Analysis
  type: featured
  image: images/space.jpg
  link: https://nasa.gov/
  description: The DynSoDA project will model the discourse aspects of language together with the deep representations of user characteristics and latent social network profiles derived from online dialogues. In contrast to current approaches, user representations will be treated as dynamically contextual. The project further envisions the use of transfer and multitask learning techniques at multiple levels of abstraction to allow the framework to work robustly across a range of NLP tasks related to social discourse (such as opinion detection, sentiment analysis, hate speech identification, argument persuasiveness prediction, and rumor evaluation in social media), to better understand the similarities between these tasks, and to scale to numerous European languages. The innovative user representations, developed in this project, can also find future applications in the area of dialog modeling, improving quality and coherence of human-machine conversations.

- title: Synthetic Data Generation and Paraphrasing for Chatbots
  type: legacy

  description: Large amounts of annotated training data are necessary to develop task-oriented dialogue sys-
    tems, which is very costly, time-consuming and requires high manual efforts, especially for an-
    notating the data. Dialogues between users and the system are difficult to obtain, often they are created manually by crowd workers.

- title: User Representation Learning across Conversational Environments
  type: legacy
  image: images/laboratory.jpg
  link: https://greenelab.com/
  description: User embeddings also
    led to substantial performance improvements in several downstream tasks, such as sentiment
    analysis, sarcasm detection or hate speech detection. The relevance of information gained from
    it is best explained by the idea of homophily, i.e., the phenomenon that people tend to associate
    more with those who appear similar. From a psychological point of view, however, a specific social situation is of great influence to
    the expressed behavior. This work aims to investigate the possibility of enhancing various
    downstream tasks by substituting context-free (static) user embeddings with contextualized
    ones dependent on the environment (e.g. Subreddit) or social situation.
