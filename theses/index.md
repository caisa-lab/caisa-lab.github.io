There are some specificities of how the bachelor/master thesis works in our group, mainly:

- the students are an integral part of our group, i.e. participate in the online chat and in the bi-weekly online group meetings (~1 hour Wednesdays) and online standups (10 min. Monday and Friday)
- the master thesis usually takes about 6 months (it is planned for about 20-24 weeks)
- once a week the student meets with the mentor (usually a PhD student or postdoc from our group), and keeps a meeting protocol (open questions, next to-dos, etc.)
- each student presents the results of the work at the group meeting, typically one intermediate presentation (after about 3 months, 10-15 min long, to get feedback), and one final presentation (25-30 min)
- the working language of our group is English, since most of the scientists are from abroad. That means, the weekly meetings with the mentor are usually in English, and the presentations to the team as well. Ideally, the work is also written in English, so that the students can also get regular feedback from the mentor while writing.
