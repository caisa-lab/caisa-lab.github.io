#### **Content**

**What is the Introduction to NLP course about?**

This course provides a technical perspective on NLP - methods for building computer software that understands and manipulates human language. Contemporary data-driven approaches are emphasized, focusing on machine learning techniques. The covered applications vary in complexity, including for example Entity Recognition, Argument Mining, or Emotion Analysis.

Through lectures, exercises, and a final project, you will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in NLP, from the linguistic basis of computational language methods to recent advances in deep learning and large language models.

**Recommended participation requirements:**

- Basic programming knowledge in Python and Machine Learning
- Basics of Machine Learning
- Basic knowledge of Python Libraries for ML (NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Pandas)
- Basics of Probability, Linear Algebra and Statistics

**Final Project (40%)** 

- **Project Types:** Students choose one of the following project types:
    - **Default Project:** Students choose one of the datasets we listed here, formulate a real-world problem (PF), and try to solve it (PS) by training a model or fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM.<br>
    Submission: [Code + Report for final results]
    - **Resource Creation Project:** To answer this question: How to generate an NLP dataset from any internet source? Students design a pipeline to build and annotate a dataset. They should define at least two NLP downstream tasks for their dataset.<br>
    Submission: [Code + Dataset + Report for formulated NLP tasks]
    - **Robustness and Reproducibility Project:** To measure the ability of a model or an NLP system to perform consistently and accurately across a wide range of inputs and conditions, students collect and annotate an evaluation set with 100 – 200 instances and test at least two models with the new evaluation set. <br>
    Submission: [Code + Evaluation set + Report for final results]

- **Project components:**
    - Problem Formulation (PF) (10%) <br>
         <pre>  [Guideline for Default Project] <br>
        [Guideline for Resource Creation Project] <br>
        [Guideline for Robustness and Reproducibility Project]
    - Problem Solving (PS) (15%)
    - Project Poster (PP) (5%): <br>
        <pre>  [Guideline for Poster]
    - Project Report (PR) (10%):
        <pre>  [Guideline for Default Project] <br>
        [Guideline for Resource Creation Project] <br>
        [Guideline for Robustness and Reproducibility Project]
- **Submission:** Depending on which project type the students choose, they submit each project component on eCampus in the following format:
    <pre>  PF: A PDF file with this name: Team_<Team number>.pdf <br>
    PP: A PDF file with this name: Team_<Team number>.pdf <br>
    PS + PR: A ZIP file containing all the necessary files with this name: Team_<Team number>.zip <br>
- **Deadlines:** All deadlines for PF, PP, and PS + PR are listed in the schedule.
- **Mentors:** Every team has a mentor, who gives feedback and advice during the project.
- **Computing resources:**
    - CS Faculty: You can add your Student ID to this list. GSG will provide you with additional computing resources on behalf of the CAISA lab.
    - Saturn Cloud: You can use 150 hours a month free of 64GB RAM and GPU instances. Check this out.
    - Google Colaboratory: Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Check this out.
- **Using external resources:** You can use any machine learning or deep learning framework you like (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.). You may use any existing code, libraries, etc., and consult papers, books, online references, etc. for your project. However, you must cite your sources in your final project report.
- **Team:**
    - **Team size:** Students should do final projects in teams of 3 up to 5 people. Larger teams are expected to do correspondingly larger projects.
    - **Building a team:** You can either find your teammates on your own or ask us to find teammates for you. You may join the CS Master Bonn Discord Server.
    - **Submission:**
        - Please send us the list of your team members via [itnlp.uni.bonn@gmail.com](mailto:itnlp.uni.bonn@gmail.com). in the following format:
            <pre>  Subject: ITNLP - WS2023 - |Matr. Nr.| <br>
            Team Speaker:   |Name|, |Matr. Nr.|, |Mail Addr. <br>
            Team Members: |Name|, |Matr. Nr.|, |Mail Addr.|
                          |Name|, |Matr. Nr.|, |Mail Addr.|
        - In case, you need a teammate, please mail us at [itnlp.uni.bonn@gmail.com](mailto:itnlp.uni.bonn@gmail.com).

            |Name|, |Matr. Nr.|, |Mail Addr.|
    - **Deadline:** is listed in the schedule.
    - **Contribution:** In the final report we ask for a statement of what each team member contributed to the project. Team members will typically get the same grade, but we may differentiate in extreme cases of unequal contribution. You can contact us in confidence in the event of unequal contribution.
