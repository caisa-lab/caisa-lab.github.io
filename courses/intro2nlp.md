### **Content**

**What is the Introduction to NLP course about?**

This course provides a technical perspective on NLP - methods for building computer software that understands and manipulates human language. Contemporary data-driven approaches are emphasized, focusing on machine learning techniques. The covered applications vary in complexity, including for example Entity Recognition, Argument Mining, or Emotion Analysis.

Through lectures, exercises, and a final project, you will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in NLP, from the linguistic basis of computational language methods to recent advances in deep learning and large language models.

**Recommended participation requirements:**

- Basic programming knowledge in Python and Machine Learning
- Basics of Machine Learning
- Basic knowledge of Python Libraries for ML (NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Pandas)
- Basics of Probability, Linear Algebra and Statistics

**Final Project (40%)** 

- **Project Types:** Students choose one of the following project types:
    - **Default Project:** Students choose one of the datasets we listed here, formulate a real-world problem (PF), and try to solve it (PS) by training a model or fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM.<br>
    Submission: [Code + Report for final results]
    - **Resource Creation Project:** To answer this question: How to generate an NLP dataset from any internet source? Students design a pipeline to build and annotate a dataset. They should define at least two NLP downstream tasks for their dataset.<br>
    Submission: [Code + Dataset + Report for formulated NLP tasks]
    - **Robustness and Reproducibility Project:** To measure the ability of a model or an NLP system to perform consistently and accurately across a wide range of inputs and conditions, students collect and annotate an evaluation set with 100 – 200 instances and test at least two models with the new evaluation set. <br>
    Submission: [Code + Evaluation set + Report for final results]

- **Project components:**
    - Problem Formulation (PF) (10%) <br>
         <pre>  [Guideline for Default Project] <br>

- **Deadlines:** All deadlines for PF, PP, and PS + PR are listed in the schedule.
- **Mentors:** Every team has a mentor, who gives feedback and advice during the project.
- **Computing resources:**
    - CS Faculty: You can add your Student ID to this list. GSG will provide you with additional computing resources on behalf of the CAISA lab.
    - Saturn Cloud: You can use 150 hours a month free of 64GB RAM and GPU instances. Check this out.
    - Google Colaboratory: Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Check this out.
- **Using external resources:** You can use any machine learning or deep learning framework you like (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.). You may use any existing code, libraries, etc., and consult papers, books, online references, etc. for your project. However, you must cite your sources in your final project report.
- **Team:**
    - **Team size:** Students should do final projects in teams of 3 up to 5 people. Larger teams are expected to do correspondingly larger projects.
    - **Building a team:** You can either find your teammates on your own or ask us to find teammates for you. You may join the CS Master Bonn Discord Server.
    - **Submission:**
        - Please send us the list of your team members via [itnlp.uni.bonn@gmail.com](mailto:itnlp.uni.bonn@gmail.com). in the following format:
            <pre>  Subject: ITNLP - WS2023 - |Matr. Nr.| <br>
            Team Speaker:   |Name|, |Matr. Nr.|, |Mail Addr. <br>
            Team Members: |Name|, |Matr. Nr.|, |Mail Addr.|
                          |Name|, |Matr. Nr.|, |Mail Addr.|
